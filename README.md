📊 Customer Churn Analysis Project
📌 About This Project

This is a beginner data analysis project where I analyzed customer subscription data to understand:

How many customers are leaving (churn rate)

Which subscription plan has more churn

How revenue is distributed

Which customers are high-risk

The goal of this project is to practice Pandas and basic data analysis.

🗂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains 30 customers with the following details:

customer_id

signup_date

last_active_date

subscription_type (Basic / Pro / Enterprise)

monthly_fee

country

age

support_tickets

churned (Yes/No)

🧹 Data Cleaning

Filled missing values in age column

Converted date columns to proper datetime format

Checked for null values

Found which subscription generates highest revenue

3️⃣ Churn by Subscription Type

Pro and Enterprise plans have low churn

4️⃣ Support Tickets Impact

Customers with more complaints are more likely to churn

5️⃣ High-Risk Customers

Identified customers with failed payments and high support tickets

💡 What I Learned

How to use Pandas for data analysis

How to group data using groupby()
